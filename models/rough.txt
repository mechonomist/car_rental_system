python version
mutable/immutable data types
advanced datatypes named tuples
python support comprehensive techniques - think this is about comprehensions
context manager
is python dynamic or static
global interpreter lock

uses of __init__, __new__, magic methods

class method, staticmethod


Done:

== and is
	The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas the Python 'is' operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.
MRO
is set ordered or unordered - unordered
map method
popular inbuilt libraries
function closures / method closures, decorators
generator
complexity of sort method in python - nlogn
does python support method overloading/overriding 
	- does not support overloading
	- supports overiding

does python support operator overloading - yes
	- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/
	- for user-defined classes - we can operator overloading by overing the magic methods associated with the operators
	- __add__ for + , __eq__ for = , 

can we use list as key in dict - tuple as key in dict --> list - not okay, tuple - okay --> since tuple is immutable
can we insert list in a set - NO
	- set elements and dictionary keys have to be hashable

uses of __init__, __new__
	 __new__ --> static method
	 		 --> method used for object creation 
	 		 --> creates an object before it is passed to the constructor, generally involves allocating space in memory
	 		 --> returns a new instance of the class
	 __init__ --> method used for object initialization
	 		  --> returns nothing
